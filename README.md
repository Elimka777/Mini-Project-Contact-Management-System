# Mini-Project: Contact Management System

Student: Elima

Steps that I followed to create the System.
1. User Interface (UI) - I designed a command-line interface (CLI) with a welcoming message and a menu.
2. Contact Data Storage - I used nested dictionaries to store contact details.
3. Menu Actions - I applied add, edit, delete, and search for contacts functions.
4. User Interaction - I executed input validation using regular expressions. 
5. Error Handling - I implemented Error Handling with try-except Blocks.
